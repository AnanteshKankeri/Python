# Snake Game

A classic **Snake** game implemented in Python using the `pygame` library. Control the snake, eat food to grow, and try to achieve the highest score without crashing into walls or yourself!

## Features
- **Dynamic Speed**: The game becomes faster as your score increases.
- **Scoring System**: Displays the current score at the top-left corner of the screen.
- **Restart Option**: Easily restart the game by pressing `R` after a game over.
- **Customizable**: Modify snake speed, colors, or grid size to make the game your own.

## Game Rules
1. Guide the snake to eat the red food. Each food increases your score by 1.
2. The snake grows longer as it eats, making the game progressively harder.
3. Avoid running into walls or the snake's own body.
4. If you crash, the game ends, and you can restart or quit.

## Customization
You can modify the following variables in the `snake_game.py` file:
- **Colors**: Change the snake, food, or background colors.
- **Speed**: Adjust the `clock.tick(10 + score // 5)` line to modify the speed progression.
- **Grid Size**: Modify `CELL_SIZE`, `WIDTH`, or `HEIGHT` for different layouts.
