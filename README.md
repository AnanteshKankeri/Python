# Flappy Bird Game with Negative Bird Effect

Welcome to the Flappy Bird game with a unique twist! This game is inspired by the classic Flappy Bird, but with a creative and artistic change to the bird and gameplay experience.

### Why Play This Game?

1. **Unique Bird Design**: The bird in this version is not just any birdâ€”it's a **realistic, inverted bird** that stands out with its striking negative color effect.
